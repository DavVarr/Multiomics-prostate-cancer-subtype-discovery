# Multiomics-prostate-cancer-subtype-discovery
Disease subtype discovery (prostate adenocarcinoma) on the TCGA dataset using similarity network fusion to integrate different omics data.
This is a repository for my bioinformatics exam, containing the R script and the report for the project.
Briefly, the task consists of integrating mRNA, miRNA and protein expression data with different methods, but mainly Similarity Network Fusion, applying Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) clustering
and comparing the results using as a reference the clusters obtained by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network with iCluster, an integrative clustering model.
